    "text": "Cluster analysis is a method of finding groups/clusters of similar individuals in our dataset, based on a set of variables. We choose the number of clusters we want to divide our data into, and each individual will be assigned to a specific cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove is an example of a cluster anlaysis with 2 clusters. Latent Class Models can also be considered to be a form of cluster analysis.\n\nCluster anlaysis is often conducted by K-means clustering. This form of clustering focuses on the distance between different individuals in our dataset. The idea is that a good clustering will have as small within-cluster variation as possible.\n\nIn other words, you want individuals in the same cluster to be similar.\n\nThus, K-means clustering tries to minimise the squared euclidean distance between all the points within a cluster and the centroid (“center”) of the cluster:\nHow do we minimise this distance? The K-means clustering algorithm works like this:\n\nChoose how many total clusters we want.\nRandomly assign each unit to one of the clusters.\nCalculate the centroids of each cluster.\nRe-assign each individual to the cluster whose centroid is closest to that individual.\nKeep repeating steps 3 to 4 until all units are in the cluster whose centroid is closest to that individual.\nRepeat the whole process a few times to find the global optimum.\n\n\nK-means clustering is algorithmic, not model based (unlike the very similar Latent Class models). This means that K-means does not have model summary statistics like AIC, or significance tests.\n\nTo interpret the clusters, we have to use our own field expertise. We look at the individuals in each cluster, as well as their mean variable values, and try to assign meaning to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Clustering Methods\n\n\n\n\n\nK-means is the most common, but not the only way to cluster. Other methods include:\n\nLatent Class Models, which we covered previously. They technically count as cluster analysis, since we are assinging individuals to a category of a latent variable. This is a model-based method.\nGaussian Mixture Modelling: this is a variation of latent class models that deals with continuous observed items, but categorical variables.\nHierarchical Cluster Anlaysis: This basically starts with each unit in its own cluster, before merging clusters that are similar. Then it repeats that continuously. We can choose to analyse any specific cluster set within this process.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo implement cluster anlaysis, we should first start by standardising our variables.\n\nvars &lt;- c(\"X1\", \"X2\", \"X3\") #names of variables to cluster by\n\n# Standardise function\nstandard &lt;- function(x){\n  (x-mean(x))/sd(x)\n}\n\n# apply standardisation\nmy_data.z &lt;- global[,c(\"Unit Names Variable\", vars)]\nmy_data.z[,vars] &lt;- sapply(my_data.z[,vars], standard)\ncolnames(my_data.z)[-1] &lt;- vars.z\ndta &lt;- merge(my_data, my_data.z, by=\"Unit Names Variable\")\n\nThen, we can implement cluster anlaysis:\n\nset.seed(1236) #set seed\n\nres &lt;- kmeans(dta[,varsz],\n                  4, #change to number of clusters\n                  nstart = 10) #number of times to run algorithm\nprint(res)\n\nWe can access each individual’s assigned cluster with the following:\n\nres$cluster\n\n\nYou can save this vector back into your original dataset for further anlaysis.",

We cannot directly observe the political ideology (the latent factor), but we can observe how they vote on different bills (the items)\n\nLatent variable models assume we can model the relationship between each observed item and the latent factor with some sort of regression model. The coefficient of each regression (often denoted \\(\\lambda\\)) is the relationship between each item and the factor.\n\nFor example, in the figure above, each item (X1, X2, X3) is related to the factor (F) with by a \\(\\lambda\\) coefficient.\n\nThese \\(\\lambda\\) are called factor loadings. We can interpret the estimated factor loadings \\(\\widehat\\lambda\\) to interpret what the unobserved factor actually is measuring.\n\nFor example, if a factor has a strong relationship with one item, and a weaker relationship with another item, we might conclude that the factor measures the first item more than the second item.\n\nWe can also use latent variable models to create factor scores \\(\\widehat\\xi\\), which are basically actual values of the latent variable for each individual \\(i\\) in our data.

Using our potential outcomes framework, we can define the treatment effect of the group that went to the hospital:\n\\[\n\\tau_\\text{went} = \\textcolor{green}{{\\text{health}}_{\\text{went}}^{(1)}} - \\textcolor{red}{{\\text{health}}_{\\text{went}}^{(0)}}\n\\]\n\nIn red is the counterfactual we do not observe. This is because the individuals who went to the hospital were treated, so we cannot see the world where they are in control.\n\nNow compare the treatment effects above to correlation, which is defined as the difference in observed outcomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{correlation} & =  \\text{health}_\\text{went} - \\text{health}_\\text{did not go} \\\\\n& = \\textcolor{green}{\\text{health}_{\\text{went}}^{(1)}} - \\textcolor{red}{\\text{health}_\\text{did not go}^{(0)}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIf we compare this correlation to our \\(\\tau_\\text{treated}\\), we see:\n\\[\n\\text{if  } \\textcolor{red}{\\text{health}_\\text{did not go}^{(0)}} ≠ \\textcolor{red}{\\text{health}_\\text{went}^{(0)}}\n\\]\nIf this is true (they are different), then correlation is not causation.\n\nThese two quantities are potential outcomes under control, or in another way to think of it, outcomes of the two groups prior to treatment happening.\n\nThus, if there is a difference between the average health outcomes between those who went to the hospital, and those who did not go to the hospital, before treatment is administered, then correlation is not equal to causation. This is because we cannot tell if the difference between the groups is due to treatment, or due to their pre-existing differences.\n\nWhat causes pre-existing differences? Confounders. For example, in our hospital-health example, a confounder could be smoking.\n\nSmoking is not the only possible confounder, we just use it as an example. Drinking, age, etc. are all other potential confounders.\n\nSmoking will worsen health outcomes. Someone who smokes is also more likely to visit the hospital with health complications. That means people who go to the hospital start out with (on average) worse health outcomes than people who did not go to the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexample2\n\n\nD\n\nGoing to the Hospital (D)\n\n\n\nY\n\nHealth Outcomes (Y)\n\n\n\nD-&gt;Y\n\n\nCausal Effect\n\n\n\nX\n\nSmoking (Confounder)\n\n\n\nX-&gt;D\n\n\n\n\n\nX-&gt;Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA confounder is a third variable that has the following characteristics:\n\nThe confounder is correlated (positive or negative) with the outcome variable.\nThe confounder causes who gets and doesn’t get the treatment.\nThe confounder is not itself caused by the treatment\n\n\n\n\n\nNote requirement 3 - it is a common mistake.

This balance between treated and untreated eliminates selection bias. We estimate the weights as follows:\n\nset.seed(333) #replicability\ngen &lt;- GenMatch(\n  Tr = df$treatment,\n  X = df[,c(\"cov1\",\"cov2\",\"pscore\")],\n      # include all covariates and pscore\n  BalanceMatrix = df[,c(\"cov1\",\"cov2\")],\n      # include all covariates\n  estimand = \"ATT\",\n  M = 2,\n  replace = TRUE,\n  ties = FALSE,\n  distance.tolerance = 0,\n  print.level = 0,\n  pop.size = 50)\n    # higher pop-size means more accuracy, but also longer (usually 200 is good)\n\nThen, matching is done with the units that have the smallest distance:\n\n# the setting below should match your choices from GenMatch()\nmodel &lt;- Match(\n  Y = df$outcome,\n  Tr = df$treatment,\n  X = df[,c(\"cov1\",\"cov2\",\"pscore\")],\n      # include all covariates and pscore\n  estimand = \"ATT\",\n  M = 2,\n  replace = TRUE,\n  ties = FALSE,\n  distance.tolerance = 0,\n  Weight.matrix = gen$Weight.matrix,\n      # tells R to use genetic matching weight matrix calculated earlier\n  Weight = 3)\n\nsummary(model)\n\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Estimate...  1.7301 \n#&gt; SE.........  0.10872 \n#&gt; T-stat.....  15.913 \n#&gt; p.val......  &lt; 2.22e-16 \n#&gt; \n#&gt; Original number of observations..............  1000 \n#&gt; Original number of treated obs...............  254 \n#&gt; Matched number of observations...............  254 \n#&gt; Matched number of observations  (unweighted).  508\n\n\nOur output estimate will be the ATT - the average treatment effect for those units who received the treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\n1) Non-parametric, so it does not need to assume a linear relationship between confounders and outcome like the fully interacted estimator.\n2) Shown to be the best performing matching estimator.\n1) Throws out unmatched data, so it wastes data.\n2) Can be computationally intensive and take a while.\n3) Only estimates the ATT, not the ATE.\n\n\n\n\nKevin’s Comments: Genetic matching is the best form of matching.

Wage Increase)\nDec 1992 (Pennsylvania, No Min. Wage Increase)\n\n\n\\(\\red{23.33}\\)\n\\(\\red{21.17}\\)\n\n\n\n\nThese are employment values in Pennsylvania, where no mininum wage changes occured.\n\nPennsylvania tells us the trend in employment without a change in minimum wage (-2.16). This trend tells us that if New Jersey hadn’t received a minimum wage increase, their employment rate would be the March 1992 level minus 2.16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 92 (NJ, Not Minimum Wage Increase)\nDec 92 (NJ, Hypothetical No Minimum Wage Increase)\n\n\n\\(\\red{20.44}\\)\n\\(\\red{\\text{March 92} - 2.16}\\)\n\n\n\n\nThe March 1992 value is copied from the first table.\n\nNow, we have an approximation of New Jersey’s missing hypothetical outcome, so we can now estimate the causal effect.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau_\\text{Dec92} & = \\green{\\text{employment}_\\text{Dec92}^{(\\text{treated})}} - \\red{\\text{employment}_\\text{Dec92}^{(\\text{control})}} \\\\\n& = \\green{\\text{employment}_\\text{Dec92}^{(\\text{treated})}} - \\left(\\red{\\text{employment}_\\text{Mar92}^{(\\text{control})}} - 2.16 \\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nThis entire idea of using another group’s trend to estimate counterfactuals depends on the critical assumption of parallel trends: that we can indeed use Pennsylvania’s trend to estimate New Jersey’s trend under control.\nParallel trends essentially says that if the treated units had hypothetically not been treated, we should expect them to follow the same trend as the untreated units.\n\nWe also require the SUTVA assumption since our potential outcomes framework is no longer valid without it. We also require the obvious assumption of no anticipation - basically the treatment is actually taking effect when we are saying it is, and people aren’t anticipating and reacting before the actual treatment takes effect.",

As the confounder changes, the outcome value will also change.\nThese issues occur when the confounder changes in value. So what if we hold the confounders constant? Then, there would be no changes in confounders - so the variation in treatment assignment and outcomes cannot be attributed to the confounder.\nFor example, let’s assume that intelligence has two values: smart and dumb. Let us calculate the treatment effect on university grades within each level of intelligence:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau_\\text{smart} & = \\green{Y_\\text{smart}^{(1)}} - \\red{Y_\\text{smart}^{(0)}}\\\\\n\\tau_\\text{dumb} & = \\green{Y_\\text{dumb}^{(1)}} - \\red{Y_\\text{dumb}^{(0)}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe confounder is constant here, so no selection bias. Thus, within each category, correlation is equal to causation. Our overall causal effect will be a weighted average of the categories:\n\\[\n\\tau = \\tau_\\text{smart} Pr(\\text{smart})  \\ + \\ \\tau_\\text{dumb} Pr(\\text{dumb})\n\\]\n\nThe weights of this weighted average are the probability/frequency of that value of the confounder.\n\nObviously, most confounders have more than 2 categories, and we often have more confounders. But the same intuition applies.\n\\[\n\\tau = \\sum_X \\tau_\\text{X} \\cdot Pr(X)\n\\]\n\nFor selection on observables to work, we need to meet 3 assumptions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumption\nDescription\n\n\nConditional Ignorability\nThis means that we must account for all possible confounders (cannot miss a single one).\n\n\nCommon Support\nThis means no one can have a 100% chance of being in treatment or control. They always have a chance to be in either, no matter their confounding values.\n\n\nStable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)\nThis means that if Ava is treated, that does not affect Mia’s outcome (and for any other 2 individuals).\n\n\n\n\nWe have a wide choice of estimators that we can use.

That means:\n\\[\n\\textcolor{red}{\\text{grades}_\\text{untreated}^{(0)}} = \\textcolor{red}{\\text{grades}_\\text{treated}^{(0)}}\n\\]\nAnd thus, since that is true, that means correlation equals causation.\n\nThis is established by the law of large numbers, but it is a little technical for here.\n\nSo if our treatment is randomly assigned (individuals randomly assigned to treatment or control), correlation does equal causation.\n\nRandomisation is the gold standard of causal inference. There is no better method.\n\nRandomisation is possible if you are running your own experiment: you can use a random number generator to assign treatment.\nRandomisation is also possible if there is something that is being randomly assigned in the real world. For example, the US green card lottery randomly chooses who gets accepted.\n\nHowever, randomisation is not always possible to due to cost of running experiments, non-compliance of individuals within experiments, and impracticality.\n\nNon-compliance is an issue that can be solved pretty easily with an instrumental variable, given a few assumptions about the non-compliance.",

The latent factor decreases with agreeing (a value of 1) with StemCell, IraqWithdraw, Immigration, and Minimum Wage.\nFrom this, we can kind of get a sense that latent variable is measuring right-left political affiliation, with higher values indicating right-wing, since agreeing left wing policies like IraqWithdraw, Immigration, and Minimum Wage are negative.\nThe absolute size of the factor loadings are quite similar - we can see that CAFTA is the least important item to the factor.\n\nTo run an item response theory mode, we need the mirt package:\n\nlibrary(mirt)\n\nThen, we run the model as follows (make sure to subset your data to only include the items).\n\nmodel &lt;- mirt(data = my_data, model = 1, SE = TRUE)\ncoef(result)\n\n\nmodel = 1 indicates how many factors you want to include.\n\nTo get factor scores, we do the following:\n\nscores &lt;- as.vector(fscores(model, method = \"EAP\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on Choosing Between Models\n\n\n\n\n\nTo compare and choose between different models, we have a few ways.\n\nWe can use a likelihood ratio test for nested models (see the regression section for more details).\n\n\nlavTestLRT(model1, model2)\n\n\nWe can use a global goodness of fit test - essentially a likelihood ratio but with the full sample covariance matrix as the null model. We want to fail to reject the null, because we want our model to be as close to the sample covariance matrix as possible.\n\n\nlavTestLRT(model)\n\n\nWe can use AIC and BIC to compare models since factor models are estimated with MLE. These are included in the output.\n\nUnfortunately, fit indicies like RMSEA do not work on IRT models.",

    "text": "Latent class models are an extension of factor analysis, that deals with cases of a categorical latent variable with categorical/binary observed items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexample2\n\n\nF\n\nξ (Unobserved)\n\n\n\nX1\n\nX1 (Observed)\n\n\n\nF-&gt;X1\n\n\nλ\n\n\n\nX2\n\nX2 (Observed)\n\n\n\nF-&gt;X2\n\n\nλ\n\n\n\nX3\n\nX3 (Observed)\n\n\n\nF-&gt;X3\n\n\nλ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe factors a categorical variable, which each category \\(c\\) called a latent class. We also have categorical observed items. The latent class models connects each item with a factor through a item response probability:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& Pr(X_1 = \\text{category }k_i \\ | \\ \\xi = \\text{category }c)\\\\\n& Pr(X_2 = \\text{category }k_i  \\ | \\ \\xi = \\text{category }c)\\\\\n& Pr(X_3 = \\text{category }k_i  \\ | \\ \\xi = \\text{category }c)\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\\(k_1\\) is one specific category of item \\(1\\), same for \\(k_2\\) for item \\(2\\), and so on. \\(c\\) is one specific category of the factor.\n\nWe also have another part of the measurement mode, the structural model, which determines the probability of each category in the factor:\n\\[\n\\alpha_c = Pr(\\xi=\\text{category }c)\n\\]\nInterpretation of the latent factor depends on the item response probabilities. Below, the columns are the different classes/categories of the factor, and the big rows are each item.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first class (the first column) has the highest probabilities if individuals never worry about crime, no real effect on quality of life, never worry about burglary, and no real effect on quality of life. Thus, we can conclude this first category of the latent variable is something like - not worried about crime.\nThe second class (the 2nd column), where the top responses have the highest probabilities except for the frequency of worry about burglaries - where the probabilities are highest for some of the time and just occasionally. This suggests that this second category is measuring something like - only worried about burglary, and no other crime.\nWe can also create factor scores - which is a little different, because now we are basically assigning every unit in our data to a category of the latent factor. This is done by calculating the posterior probability of being in each class:\n\\[\n\\widehat{Pr}(\\xi = \\text{category }c \\ | \\ X_1 = \\text{category }k_1, X_2 = \\text{category }k_2, \\dots )\n\\]\nWe calculate this probability for all categories \\(c\\) in the factor. Whichever category \\(c\\) of the latent variable has the highest probability, is the category a unit is assigned to.\n\nThis can be considered quite similar to that of cluster analysis, which will be introduced later.\n\n\nTo implement latent class models, we will need the polLCA package:\n\nlibrary(poLCA)\n\nThis package requires that our categories of items are labelled starting with 1. This means if you have a binary variable of 0 and 1, you will need to change it to 1 and 2.\nTo begin, we will first need to create a vector of our item names:\n\nvars &lt;- c(\"item1\",\"item2\",\"item3\",\"item4\")\n\nThen, let us fit our model as follows:\n\nform &lt;- cbind(item1, item2, item3, item4) ~1\nmodel &lt;- poLCA(form,\n              my_data[,vars],\n              nclass = 2, #number of categories for factor\n              na.rm = F,\n              nrep = 10) \n\n\nna.rm = F means to include missing values when estimating (which is recommended). nrep = 10 indicates how many times to run the gradient descent algorithm - more is better, but will take longer.\n\nThe traditional output is hard to read, so we will use a function:\n\n# function\nLCA.probs &lt;- function(res){\n  probs &lt;- res$probs\n  item.p &lt;- NULL\n  for(i in seq_along(probs)){\n        m.tmp &lt;- t(probs[[i]])\n        rownames(m.tmp) &lt;- paste(names(probs)[i],colnames(probs[[i]]),sep=\".\")\n        item.p &lt;- rbind(item.p,m.tmp)\n  }\n  item.p &lt;- round(item.p,3)\n  class.p &lt;- res$P\n  names(class.p) &lt;- colnames(item.p)\n  list(item.probabilities=item.p,class.probabilities=class.p)\n}\n\n# output results\nLCA.probs(model)\n\nWe can calculate factor scores/classification as follows:\n\nmodel$predclass\n\nWe can choose our model based on the AIC or BIC score.\n\nmodel$aic\nmodel$bic",

    "text": "Note: PCA is not a latent variable model itself, but can be used to approximate a latent variable model.\n\nPrinciple components analysis (PCA) takes observed variables (called features), and change them into new variables called principle components, without losing any information.\nEssentially, what PCA does is it takes our features, and finds the “axis” in which there is the most variation, and makes that the 1st component. Then it finds the “axis” with the 2nd most variation, and makes that the 2nd component, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that each principle component is orthogonal/uncorrelated with each other by design. Also note that the 1st component explains the most variance in our features, then the 2nd component, and so on.\n\nEach new principle component is a weighted average of the observed variables:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\comp_1 & = \\omega_{11}\\feat_1 + \\omega_{21}\\feat_2 + \\omega_{31}\\feat_3 + \\dots \\\\\n\\comp_2 & = \\omega_{12}\\feat_1 + \\omega_{22} \\feat_2 + \\omega_{32}\\feat_3 + \\dots \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe \\(\\omega\\)’s are the weights of each observed feature in creating a principle component, and are determined by the correlation matrix of the features. For interpreting a component, we often “normalise” the weights \\(\\omega\\) to get the correlation between a observed feature and a principle component:\n\\[\nCorr(\\feat_i, \\comp_j) =  \\omega_{ij} \\cdot \\sqrt{Var(\\comp_j)}\n\\]\n\nThis value is also called a component loading. Note that this is only true given we perform PCA on the correlation matrix (which is standard, but you can use a covariance matrix).\n\nInterpreting the principle components is identical to that of factor analysis - just using correlations rather than factor loadings. Below, the rows are features describing how much an individual trusts different institutions. The columns are the principle components.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn component 1, we see that the correlation is pretty high for all of the variables, and positive. We might conclude component 1 measures general trust in institutions.\nIn component 2, we can see that the loadgins for legal and police are the highest (in absolute terms) and negative. Meanwhile, politicians, pol_parties, and EP are positive and still not too small. The other loadings are quite small. We might interpret this component as sort of a tradeoff between political trust and legal/law enforcement trust, with higher values indicating more political trust, and lower values indicating more trust in legal/police.\nJust like factor analysis, we can also calculate principle component scores, which are the individual values of each principle component for each individual in our data.\n\nTo implement principle components analysis, we do the following:\n\npca &lt;- princomp(~ X1 + X2 + X3,\n                data = my_data,\n                cor = TRUE, #use correlation matrix\n                scores = TRUE, #calculate pc scores\n                na.action=na.exclude)\nsummary(pca)\n\nNow, to get the component loadings/corelation, we do the following:\n\n# grab the weights\nweights &lt;- loadings(pca)\n\n# grab the sqrt of variance\nsqrt.var &lt;- pca$sdev\n\n# calculate component loadings/correlation\nprint(t(t(weights)*sqrt.var), cutoff = 0, digits=4)\n\nTo access principle component scores, we do:\n\npca$score\n\nIf we are performing other statistical analysis, we might want to choose how many of the new principle components we want to use. A scree-plot shows the percentage of variance each component explains.\n\nscreeplot(pca, type='l', main=\"\")\n\n\nTo choose the amount of components to use, we look for the “elbow” in the plot - basically when adding another additional PC does not really increase the amount of variance explained significantly anymore.",
