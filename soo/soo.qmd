title: "Selection on Observables"

Our issue in causal inference is that a confounder is causing pre-existing differences:

::: center-graph
```{dot}
//| fig-width: 4
//| fig-height: 1.1
digraph example2 {
  bgcolor="transparent";
  // Nodes
  D [shape=box, pos = "0,0!", label="Receiving Scholarship (D)"]
  X [shape=box, pos = "2,0!", label="Intellegence (Confounder)"]
  Y [shape=box, pos = "1,-1!", label="University Grades (Y)"]

  // Edges
  {rank=same; D -> Y [label="Causal Effect"]}
  X -> D
  X -> Y [dir=both]
  
  graph [nodesep=0.5, ranksep=0.5]

}
```
:::

By definition, as the confounder **changes**, your likelihood of getting treatment changes. As the confounder **changes**, the outcome value will also change.

These issues occur when the confounder **changes** in value. So what if we hold the confounders constant? Then, there would be no changes in confounders - so the variation in treatment assignment and outcomes cannot be attributed to the confounder.

For example, let's assume that intelligence has two values: smart and dumb. Let us calculate the treatment effect on university grades within each level of intelligence:

$$
\begin{align}
\tau_\text{smart} & = \green{Y_\text{smart}^{(1)}} - \red{Y_\text{smart}^{(0)}}\\
\tau_\text{dumb} & = \green{Y_\text{dumb}^{(1)}} - \red{Y_\text{dumb}^{(0)}}
\end{align}
$$

The confounder is constant here, so no selection bias. Thus, within each category, correlation is equal to causation. Our overall causal effect will be a weighted average of the categories:

$$
\tau = \tau_\text{smart} Pr(\text{smart})  \ + \ \tau_\text{dumb} Pr(\text{dumb})
$$

::: small
The weights of this weighted average are the probability/frequency of that value of the confounder.

Obviously, most confounders have more than 2 categories, and we often have more confounders. But the same intuition applies.

$$
\tau = \sum_X \tau_\text{X} \cdot Pr(X)
$$

For selection on observables to work, we need to meet 3 assumptions:

|                                                         |                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Assumption]{.smallcaps}                                | [Description]{.smallcaps}                                                                                                                                 |
| [Conditional Ignorability]{.mark}                       | This means that we must account for **all** possible confounders (cannot miss a single one).                                                              |
| [Common Support]{.mark}                                 | This means no one can have a 100% chance of being in treatment or control. They always have a chance to be in either, no matter their confounding values. |
| [Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)]{.mark} | This means that if Ava is treated, that does not affect Mia's outcome (and for any other 2 individuals).                                                  |
