I have moved most my notes to two other repositories:

1.  For causal inference notes, see my [Introduction to Causal Inference repository](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/).

2.  For R-code on implementation and description of modern difference-in-differences, see my [DiD resources repository](https://kevinli03.github.io/did/).
