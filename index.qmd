For my personal website, see <http://kevinli03.github.io>

This repository contains resources on causal inference and social statistics, specifically focused on applications to politics and economics.

-   Use the top navigation bar to navigate between different methods.
-   Use the side navigation bar to navigate within a method.

R-code for implementation is included. There are some stuff that doesn't fit into any category, which I have included in the home page sidebar.

**Notation Notes**:

-   For potential outcomes, green means under treatment, and red means under control.
-   $i$ refers to units within our data, and $t$ refers to time periods.
-   Greek letters are used for **parameters** that need to be estimated. I typically use $\beta$ for most coefficients multiplied to variables, $\tau$ to represent causal effects, and $\eps$ to represent the error term.
