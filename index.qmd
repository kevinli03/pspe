This repository contains resources on causal inference, and applying causal inference methods to political science and political economy.

-   Use the top navigation bar to navigate between different methods.

-   Use the side navigation bar to navigate within a method.

-   R-code for implementation is included.

-   I have tried to keep up with modern advancements, including the recent difference-in-differences rennaisance.

These resources have been collected throughout my postgraduate degree at the London School of Economics. I hope these resources can be useful for my future self and others.

I try to ensure everything in this repository is accurate. If there are any issues with the repository, let me know.
