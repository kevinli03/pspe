This repository contains resources on causal inference and social statistics, specifically focused on applications to politics and economics.

-   Use the top navigation bar to navigate between different methods.

-   Use the side navigation bar to navigate within a method.

-   R-code for implementation is included.

-   I have tried to keep up with modern advancements, including the recent difference-in-differences rennaisance.

These resources have been collected throughout my postgraduate degree at the London School of Economics. I hope these resources can be useful for my future self and others. I try to ensure everything in this repository is accurate. If there are any issues with the repository, let me know.

There are some stuff that doesn't fit into any category, which I have included in the home page sidebar.
