When estimating factor analysis models, we encounter many identification issues. An identification issue is basically an inability to calculate a solution. There are two types of identification issues:

1.  We have too many possible solutions, and we cannot determine which one (a unique identification issue).
2.  We don't have enough data to compute any solutions.

One identification issue is **rotation**. For example, imagine our latent variable is left-right political spectrum leaning. Our latent variable could use positive values for right-wing and negative values for left-wing. Or, it could do the opposite. There is no real substantive difference.

Thus, in 1-factor models, most software will arbitrarily choose a rotation, as it does not really make a huge difference.

In multiple factor models, rotation becomes more complex. Because of some linear algebra, you can have almost infinite rotations of factors that make no difference. Just like in the 1-factor model, software will arbitrarily choose one rotation.

However, in multiple factor models, the chosen rotation can make a big difference in how easy it is to interpret our solutions.

-   The default rotation is often an **orthogonal rotation**. This means the factors (if visualised in space) are perpendicular to each other, with zero correlation.
-   An **oblique rotation** is one where the factors are allowed to be correlated with each other (non-perpindicular).

The **oblique rotations** are generally easier to interpret. This is because they make some items have close to 0 factor loadings, which means we can easily say that factor is not measuring that specific item.

Rotations are a unique identification issue. Factor analysis also has some lack-of-parameters identification issues that result in no possible solutions. To avoid this, we should generally have at least 3 items for a 1-factor model, and 2 items per factor for a multiple-factor model.
