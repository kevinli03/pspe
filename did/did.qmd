In April 1992, New Jersey increased its minimum wage. We might wonder how that caused changes in employment We have data from before and after the change:

|                                                    |                                                   |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|

| 20.44                                              | 21.03                                             |

More specifically, this is employment rates at fast food restaurants.

Our treatment effect after the raise of minimum wage in December 1992 would be:

$$
\begin{align}
\tau_\text{ATT} = & \ \text{employment with min. wage increase (Dec 92)} \\
& -\red{\text{hypothetical employment without min. wage increase (Dec 92)}}
\end{align}
$$

We **don't** observe the hypothetical in December 1992 without the minimum wage increase.

::: small
We cannot use March 1992 because there could have been something that happened between March and December that changes the **trend** in employment (like a recession).
:::

**Difference-in-differences** estimates the hypothetical by looking at another state that did not receive a change in minimum wage during this time - like Pennsylvania:

|                                                              |                                                              |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| [Mar 1992 (Pennsylvania, No Min. Wage Increase)]{.smallcaps} | [Dec 1992 (Pennsylvania, No Min. Wage Increase)]{.smallcaps} |
| 23.33                                                        | 21.17                                                        |

: {tbl-colwidths="\[50,50\]" .bordered}

::: small
These are employment values in Pennsylvania, where no mininum wage changes occured.
:::

Pennsylvania tells us the **trend** in employment without a change in minimum wage (-2.16). This trend tells us that if New Jersey hadn't received a minimum wage increase, their employment rate would be the March 1992 level minus 2.16.

|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| [Mar 92 (NJ, Not Minimum Wage Increase)]{.smallcaps} | [Dec 92 (NJ, Hypothetical No Minimum Wage Increase)]{.smallcaps} |
| 20.44                                                | 20.44 - 2.16                                                     |

::: small
The March 1992 value is copied from the first table.
:::

Now, we have an approximation of New Jersey's missing hypothetical outcome, so we can now estimate the causal effect.

$$
\begin{align}
\tau_\text{Dec92} = & \ \text{employment with min. wage increase (Dec 92)} \\
& -{\text{(estimate) employment without min. wage increase (Dec 92)}}
\end{align}
$$

This entire idea of using another group's trend to estimate counterfactuals depends on two assumptions:

|                                                         |                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| [Assumption]{.smallcaps}                                | [Description]{.smallcaps}                                                                                                   |
| [Parallel Trends]{.mark}                                | This means that had the treated group not received treatment, they would have followed the same trend as the control group. |
| [Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)]{.mark} | This means that if Ava is treated, that does not affect Mia's outcome (and for any other 2 individuals).                    |

::: small
I will show how to test for parallel trends later in Dynamic treatment effects.

There are two types of difference-in-differences designs - classical and staggered, which we will cover in the next few pages.
