title: "Stagged DiD and Issues with TWFE"

In the classical difference-in-differences design, all units in the treatment group receive treatment at the same time. However, in reality, this is not that common. It is very common that some units receive treatment before others.

For example, in the US, states often adopt different policies at different times - such as the staggered adoption of mail-in voting, or the staggered adoption of the common core curriculum.

The **staggered difference-in-differences** design is an extension on the classical design, which allows for staggered implementation of treatment.

The [two-way fixed effects](twfe.qmd) estimator is operates differently in a staggered setting. Let's say we have 3 groups - a group treated early, a group that was treated late, and a untreated group.

Two-way fixed effects essentially estimates 4 different differences, shown below:

The actual TWFE estimate is a weighted average of these differences. The weights are a function of mainly the telative timing of treatment - groups treated more in the middle (so not too early or too late) are weighted higher. The weights are seen below in the figure.

There are two problems with these comparison conducted by TWFE:

1.  Some of these comparison (see comparison D above) may be "forbidden" - such that already-treated units are used as controls after they are treated.
2.  Weighting can result in weird weights - sometimes some groups treated early/late might receive negative weights (see figure above).

[This site](https://asjadnaqvi.github.io/DiD/docs/code_r/06_bacon_r/) shows how you can explore the comparison and weighting issue in R. See [Goodman-Bacon (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304407621001445) for a more technical overview of TWFE decomposition.

These problems with TWFE mean that TWFE is **biased** in estimating the ATT in staggered difference-in-differences when there is heterogenous treatment effects.

::: small
TWFE is unbiased with homogeneity, but homogeneity is quite rare in scenarios we typically research.
