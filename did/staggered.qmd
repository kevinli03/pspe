Ensure you understand the classical difference-in-differences design before starting this.

In the classical difference-in-differences design, all units in the treatment group receive treatment at the same time.

However, in reality, this is not that common. It is very common that some units receive treatment before others. For example, in the US, states often adopt different policies at different times - such as the staggered adoption of mail-in voting, or the staggered adoption of the common core cirriculum.

The **staggered difference-in-differences** design is an extension on the classical design, which allows for staggered implementation of treatment.

Essentially, this design is a combination of a bunch of smaller classical difference-in-differences designs.

-   For example, consider that we have 4 groups. Group 1 receives the treatment in period 1, group 2 receives the treatment in period 2, and group 3 receives the treatment in period 3. Group 4 never receives the treatment.
-   In this scenario, we essentially have 3 smaller classical difference-in-differences combined into one larger study: one for group 1, one for group 2, and one for group 3.

Just like in the classical design, the staggered design can acommodate panel data (more common) or repeated cross-sections. Unlike the classical design however, there are far more estimators to choose from.

| The TWFE estimator is possible in staggered DiD just like in the classical design - and is quite simple. However, there are a variety of issues outlined here, that make it more dubious.       |

| This estimator accounts for the issues with TWFE. It is mainly focused on estimating dynamic treatment effects.                                                                                 |

| This estimator accounts for the issues with TWFE by only comparing units that should be compared. It is the most popular design nowadays.                                                       |
