The two-way fixed effects estimator is the estimator for classical DiD, and works (albiet poorly) for staggered DiD and non-absorbing DiD:

$$
Y_{it} = \underbrace{\unit + \time}_{\text{fixed effects}} + D_{it}\att + \cov + \eps_{it}
$$

::: small
In repeated cross-sections, we have to replace the unit fixed effects $\alpha_i$ with group fixed effects, group being the level on which treatment is assigned (ex. if treatment is assigned at a state level, we use state fixed effects).

```{r}
#| echo: false

data(base_did, package = "fixest")
df <- base_did
colnames(df) <- c("outcome", "covariate", "unit", "time", "post", "ever.treat")
df$treatment <- df$post*df$ever.treat
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| comment: "#>"
#| class-output: r

model <- feols(
  outcome ~ treatment + covariate | unit + time,
  data = df)
coeftable(model) # Can also use summary(model)
```

::: small
The estimate for treatment is the ATT. In this example, it is 4.850645.

For dynamic treatment effects, we can

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
data(base_stagg, package = "fixest")
df <- base_stagg
colnames(df) <- c("unit", "time", "first.treated", "rel.time", "treat", "te", "covariate", "outcome")

df <- df %>%
  mutate(rel.time = time - first.treated)
```

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-height: 3.5

model <- feols(
  outcome ~ i(rel.time, -1) + covariate | unit + time,
      # rel.time is: time period - initial treatment period of a unit
      # thus, rel.time = 0 is first treatment year. negative is pre-treat.
  data = df)

iplot(
  model,
  drop = "[[:digit:]]{2}", # this limits pre-post period to -9 to 9.
  ref.line = 0)
```

::: small
Negative rel.time (pre-treatment) should have 0 significant effects if parallel trends is met. Here, we can see parallel trends is violated. Post rel.time are the dynamic treatment effects over time.

As has been mentioned, TWFE is a poor estimator for staggered DiD or non-absorbing DiD. The reason for this is because of two factors:

1.  TWFE will make "forbidden" comparisons between treatment groups. For example, TWFE will compare treated units to later-treated units. This is an issue - causal effects should only compare treated to untreated units.

2.  TWFE does not weight comparisons properly. In the real ATT, comparisons between different groups should be weighted based on how large these different groups are (how many units are in each group). But, in TWFE, weighting depends on treatment timing, not group size. This means some groups may be negatively weighted (which is nonsensical).

[This site](https://asjadnaqvi.github.io/DiD/docs/code_r/06_bacon_r/) shows how you can explore the comparison and weighting issue in R. See [Goodman-Bacon (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304407621001445) for a more technical overview of TWFE decomposition.
