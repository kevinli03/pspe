See [Goodman-Bacon (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304407621001445) for a more technical overview of TWFE decomposition.

The [two-way fixed effects](twfe.qmd) estimator is possible with staggered difference-in-differences. But what is TWFE actually doing? Let's say we have 3 groups - a group treated early, a group that was treated late, and a untreated group.

Two-way fixed effects essentially estimates 4 different differences, shown below:

The actual TWFE result is a weighted average of these differences. The weights are a function of mainly the telative timing of treatment - groups treated more in the middle (so not too early or too late) are weighted higher. The weights are seen below in the figure.

There are two problems with these comparison conducted by TWFE:

1.  Some of these comparison (see comparison D above) may be "forbidden" - such that already-treated units are used as controls after they are treated.
2.  Weighting can result in weird weights - sometimes some groups treated early/late might receive negative weights (see figure above).

[This site](https://asjadnaqvi.github.io/DiD/docs/code_r/06_bacon_r/) shows how you can explore the comparison and weighting issue in R.

These problems with TWFE mean that TWFE is **biased** in estimating the ATT in staggered difference-in-differences when there is heterogenous treatment effects.

::: small
TWFE is unbiased with homogeneity, but homogeneity is quite rare in scenarios we typically research.
