Recall our two-way fixed effects model:

$$
\text{outcome}_{it} = \underbrace{\alpha_i\ \text{unit}_i + \gamma_t\ \text{period}_t}_{\text{fixed effects}} + \blue\tau \ \text{treatment}_{it} + \beta \ \text{covariates}_{it} + \eps_{it}
$$

This also implies a model for the potential outcomes - the potential outcome under control is when $D=0$, and the potential outcome under treatment is $D=1$:

$$
\begin{align}
\purple{\text{outcome}_{it}^{(\text{treated})}} & = \alpha_i\ \text{unit}_i + \gamma_t\ \text{period}_t + \blue\tau + \beta \ \text{covariates}_{it} + \eps_{it} \\
\purple{\text{outcome}_{it}^{(\text{untreated})}} & = \alpha_i\ \text{unit}_i + \gamma_t\ \text{period}_t + \beta \ \text{covariates}_{it} + \eps_{it}
\end{align}
$$

These are obtained by simply plugging in $\text{treatment}_{it}=0,1$ into the TWFE equation.

Gardner (2021) proposes to solve the [issues with two-way fixed effects](twfestaggered.qmd) regarding "forbidden comparisons" and "weighting" problems by simply estimating the counterfactuals $\red{Y_{it}^{(0)}}$ for treated units in the post-period. With these counterfactuals, we can calculate the treatment effect directly without weighting or forbidden comparisons.

To estimate the counterfactuals, we first run a regression with **only untreated/not-yet treated observations** $\text{treatment}=0$:

$$
\text{outcome}_{it} = \alpha_i\ \text{unit}_i + \gamma_t\ \text{period}_t + \beta \ \text{covariates}_{it} + \eps_{it}
$$

This regression will provide estimates for $\widehat\alpha_i$, $\widehat\gamma_t$, and $\widehat{\beta}$ using only untreated data. This will allow us to estimate the $\text{outcome}_{it}^{(\text{untreated})}$ potential outcomes for all units, including the counterfactuals for the treated units and the observed potential outcomes for untreated units.

$$
\blue{\widehat{\text{outcome}}_{it}^{(\text{untreated})}} = \widehat\alpha_i\ \text{unit}_i + \widehat\gamma_t\ \text{period}_t + \widehat\beta \ \text{covariates}_{it}
$$

Now, let us find the difference between our observed $\text{outcome}_{it}$ values in our dataset and our estimated $Y_{it}^{(0)}$ potential outcomes, which we will call the **residual**:

$$
\begin{align}
\widetilde{\text{residual}}_{it} & = \text{outcome}_{it} - \blue{\widehat{\text{outcome}}_{it}^{(\text{untreated})}} \\
& = \text{outcome}_{it} - \left(\widehat\alpha_i\ \text{unit}_i + \widehat\gamma_t\ \text{period}_t + \widehat\beta \ \text{covariates}_{it} \right)
\end{align}
$$

-   For untreated units, their observed outcome is equal to the potential outcome $\purple{\text{outcome}_{it}^{(\text{untreated})}}$, so the residual should be 0.
-   For treated units, their observed outcome is the potential outcome $\purple{\text{outcome}_{it}^{(\text{treated})}}$, so the residual isessentially measuring the individual causal effect.

Thus, with the full dataset, we run the following regression to obtain the causal effect:

$$
\widetilde{\text{residual}}_{it} = \delta + \blue\tau \ \text{treatment}_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
$$

The estimated $\blue{\widehat\tau}$ is the estimate of the ATT, that should be free of the issues that TWFE faces in staggered difference-in-differences. The same mechanics can be used to calculate dynamic treatment effects for each time period.

The standard errors will be incorrect, so Gardner (2021) uses a generalised method of moments estimator to correct the standard errors.

To implement 2-stage difference-in-differences, we need the **did2s** package:

```{r, eval = F}
library(did2s)
```

For the estimation of the ATT, we do the following:

```{r, eval = F}
model <- did2s(data = my_data,
               yname = "Y",
               first_stage = ~ X1 + X2 | unit + period, #if no covariates, put "0"
               second_stage = ~i(D), #i() makes it a factor variable
               treatment = "D",
               cluster_var = "unit")
model
```

For estimation of dynamic treatment effects (and testing of parallel trends), we do the following:

```{r, eval = F}
model <- did2s(data = my_data,
               yname = "Y",
               first_stage = ~ X1 + X2 | unit + period, #if no covariates, put "0"
               second_stage = ~i(time_to_treat, ref = c(-1, Inf)),
               treatment = "D",
               cluster_var = "unit")
model
iplot(model) #to view dynamic treatment effects plot
```

::: small
Note: the **inf** is the reference for the never-treated control group, for the variable time_to_treat. If it is NA's, then you do not need to include it, just put ref = -1.
